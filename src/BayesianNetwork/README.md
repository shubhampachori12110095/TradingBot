The main idea I want to test is to use Bayesian networks to evaluate if it's worth to buy stocks of a company given a set of prices on a time interval.
Consider n economic Indicators, from I1 to In and Rho being the profit in terms of percentage, the probability of having a profit Rho is given by<br/><img src="http://i.imgur.com/o3cuh5N.png" align="center" border="0" alt="\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} p(Rho|I_i)}{n}" width="118" height="47" />

TODO: I still have to finish explaining how I'm going to model the problem here.

<!--\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} p(Rho|I_i)}{n}-->
