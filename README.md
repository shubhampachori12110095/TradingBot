#Trading Bot

I created this repository to test an idea, probably this will be my final project for the algotrading class.

There are two ideas I want to try:

On the first one I want to test using Bayesian networks to evaluate if it's worth to buy stocks of a company given a set of prices on a time interval.

On the second idea I want to try using Artificial Neural Networks to try to evaluate when is a good oportunity to buy or sell a stock.

There is a detailed explanation of each idea on their respectives folders.
