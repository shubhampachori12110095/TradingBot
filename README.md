#Trading Bot

I created this repository to test an idea, probably this will be my final project for the algotrading class.

The main idea I want to test is to use Bayesian networks to evaluate if is worth to buy stocks of a company given a set of prices on a time interval.
Consider n economic Indicators, from I1 to In and Rho being the profit in terms of percentage, the probability of having a profit Rho is given by <img src="http://www.sciweavers.org/upload/Tex2Img_1443022398/render.png" />

<!--\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} p(Rho|I_i)}{n}-->
